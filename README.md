# C++ Learning Adventure!

Starting a C++ Learning Adventure!

I've currently finished the book "Beginning C++ Through Game Programming" book and am currently working through Bjarne's book "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++". I have catalogued my work through the books I'm studying under "bookwork" folder. 

In addition to the "bookwork" folder I have some small side-projects in the "projects" folder that aren't developed at all but are little refresher/breaks between chapters I'm reading.
One notable mention is in the "Arduino" folder under "projects" that utilizes a BME280 sensor and outputs readings to a small OLED screen.

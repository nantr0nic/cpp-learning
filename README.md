# C++ Learning Adventure!

My C++ Learning Adventure!

I've finished the books "Beginning C++ Through Game Programming" and Bjarne's book "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++". I have catalogued my work through the books I'm studying under "bookwork" folder. One thing I'm proud of from going through Bjarne's book is a [deep dive into C++ object semantics](https://github.com/nantr0nic/cpp-learning/blob/main/bookwork/ppp3/deep_dive.md), which took me on a tour of several related concepts.

In addition to the "bookwork" folder I have some small side-projects in the "projects" folder that aren't developed at all but are little refresher/breaks between chapters I'm reading.
One notable mention is in the "Arduino" folder under "projects" that utilizes a BME280 sensor and outputs readings to a small OLED screen. 

Some areas of interest within C++ (though I'm primarily working on learning the fundamentals of the language) are game programming and Arduino / ESP32 / microcontroller programming.

If you have any suggestions, comments, questions, or musings I'm always happy to hear from you :)

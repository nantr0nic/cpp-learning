# C++ Learning Adventure!

Starting a C++ Learning Adventure!

I've finished the book "Beginning C++ Through Game Programming" book and am currently working through Bjarne's book "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++". I have catalogued my work through the books I'm studying under "bookwork" folder. 

In addition to the "bookwork" folder I have some small side-projects in the "projects" folder that aren't developed at all but are little refresher/breaks between chapters I'm reading.
One notable mention is in the "Arduino" folder under "projects" that utilizes a BME280 sensor and outputs readings to a small OLED screen. 

Some areas of interest within C++ (though I'm trying to focus on learning the fundamentals of the language) are SFML / game programming and Arduino / ESP32 / microcontroller programming.

If you have any suggestions, comments, questions, or musings I'm always happy to hear from you :)

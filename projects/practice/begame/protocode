## 1.0
Some kind of text-based roguelike with a very simple dungeon ASCII map.
Use as a way to practice stuff learned in C++ book. 

- player is melee fighter
- go through dungeons and fight enemies for rewards
- use rewards to level up before next dungeon
- try to make a basic ascii map

## 2.0
 - add weapons/buffs
 - expand map + add a town, maybe follow Kevin's dungeon spread idea

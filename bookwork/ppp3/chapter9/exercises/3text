Okay... Here's a document with several lines.
I need contractions like "don't" and "won't",
So let's try don't and won't.
I need punctation like: "!" "?" and "-" so...
Meow! Poop! but now: "Meow!", "Poop!".
Did that work? Let's see.
Oh, and de-regulate but don't de - regulate.
Shouldn't have taken this long but at least I
didn't give up :)

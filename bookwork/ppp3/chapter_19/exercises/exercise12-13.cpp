*                                Exercise 12                                 *
*  Complete the definition of list from §19.3 and get the high() example to  *
*            run. Allocate a Link to represent one past the end.             *
*                                                                            *

*   We don’t really need a “real” one-past-the-end Link for a list. Modify   *
*your solution to the previous exercise to use nullptr to represent a pointer*
* to the (nonexistent) one-past-the-end Link (list<Elem>::end()); that way,  *
*  the size of an empty list can be equal to the size of a single pointer.   *

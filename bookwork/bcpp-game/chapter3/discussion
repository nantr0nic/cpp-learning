DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
1. What are some of the things from your favorite game that you could
represent as objects? What might their data members and member
functions be?
2. What are the advantages of using an array over a group of individual
variables?
3. What are some limitations imposed by a fixed array size?
4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of operator overloading?
5. What kinds of games could you create using string objects, arrays, and
for loops as your main tools?

1. NPC's in the world are individual objects. Their data members might include their
    name and health points. Their member functions would be to speak when I'm within
    a specific distance to them.

2. Some advantages of using an array over a group of individual variables are: related
    things are stored together under the same name (e.g. an inventory list), the items
    in an array can be manipulated simultaneously whereas individual variables need to
    be manipulated independently (or at the very least it is least cumbersome to do so
    with an array).

3. A fixed array size limits the possible manipulations of that array. For example, if
    an inventory can hold 10 items and it is defined as an array[9] then a possible
    upgrade of inventory size would require declaring a new array of the new size and
    copying the old array to the new one.

4. One advantage of operator overloading is being able to use simple operators for multiple
    applications; by overloading operators you can maximize the uses of basic symbols like
    +, -, and so on. One disadvantage is the potential for confusion and thereby misusing 
    a symbol.

5. You can create simple games like wordle or hangman; and also more complex text-based
    combat games.

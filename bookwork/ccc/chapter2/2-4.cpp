/*
char --> The default type, always 1 byte. May or may not be signed. (Example: ASCII.)
char16_t --> Used for 2-byte character sets. (Example: UTF-16.)
char32_t --> Used for 4-byte character sets. (Example: UTF-32.)
signed char --> Same as char but guaranteed to be signed.
unsigned char --> Same as char but guaranteed to be unsigned.
wchar_t --> Large enough to contain the largest character of the implementationâ€™s locale. (Example: Unicode.)
